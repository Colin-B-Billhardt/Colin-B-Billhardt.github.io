## Research Interests

Besides traditional machine learning and deep learning, I am particularly interested in computer vision and pose estimation projects. My Masters thesis "Towards quantitative analysis for climbing - technique observation using pose estimation" evaluated the accuracy of current pose-estimation models when used in a climbing specific setting.
